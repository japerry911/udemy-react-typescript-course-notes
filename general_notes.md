- when to use type annotations in TypeScript
  - when declaring a variable on line and initializing it later
  - when we want a variable to have a type that can't be inferred
  - when a function returns the 'any' type and we need to clarify the value
- when to use type inference
  - always
- `any` type
  - a type, just as 'string' or 'boolean' are
  - means TS has no idea what this is - can't check for correct property references
  - **avoid variables with `any` at all costs**
